From the entities provided by the user, identify all pairs of entities that are *clearly related* to each other in the user-provided text and extract the relationship between them.

For each relationship you should include:
- Relationship strength: a integer score from 1 to 10 indicating the strength of the relationship between the pair of entities.
- Relationship description: an explanation as to why you think the relationship exists and the how the pair of entities are related to each other.

Please provide your response in the format below:

{
    "relationships": [
        {"entities":{"first":"<first-entity>","second":"<second-entity>"},"description":"<relationship-description>","strength":<strength-score>},
        {"entities":{"first":"<first-entity>","second":"<second-entity>"},"description":"<relationship-description>","strength":<strength-score>},
        {"entities":{"first":"<first-entity>","second":"<second-entity>"},"description":"<relationship-description>","strength":<strength-score>}
    ]
}

Constraints:
- Only extract relationships that are mentioned in the text.
- Do not infer or assume information that is not present in the text.
- Use common sense and general knowledge to inform your relationship choices.
- The output MUST be in JSON format.

            Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.
            The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.
            The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.
            They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.
            The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.

            Chris Urmson: Yeah, no, and it is, right? I think one of the things that people outside of Silicon Valley who haven’t been here don’t realize is that it’s not really. That, like, you know, people talk about Silicon Valley engineers being risk-takers. I think it’s actually the opposite. It’s the realization that if you go and try one of these things and you’re actually good at what you do, if it fails, it fails. You’ll have a job the next day at somewhere else, right? And you’ll have this wealth of experience that people will value. And I think that is something that it’s hard, you know, I’ll categorize this as you know east coast people but, you know, kind of more conventional business folks haven’t — don’t kind of have that sense of the opportunities that are around.
