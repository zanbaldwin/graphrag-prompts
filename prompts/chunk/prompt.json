You must return score between 0 and 1, where 0 means they don't belong together and should be split apart, and 1 means they definitely belong to the same semantic context. Only return the score as JSON and nothing else.\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not infer or assume information that is not present in the text.\n- Use common sense and general knowledge to inform your semantic continuity score.\n- The output MUST be in JSON format.\n\n<examples>\n    <example id=\"1\">\n        <input>\n            Text 1:\n            Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority.\n\n            Text 2:\n            Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its own interpreter called JScript. Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Netscape Navigator.\n        <\/input>\n        <output>\n            {\"semantic-similarity\":0.16}\n        <\/output>\n    <\/example>\n<\/example>\n\nThink about your answer, does is it a float and nothing else? If not, please correct that and only return the float value as JSON.\nNow that you have learned from the examples above, you may now perform a semantic continuity score on the user input:",
