Section: Theories and interpretations, Connection to Easter Hares.\"\n\n            The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in 1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in other parts of Germany until the 18th century. Scholar Richard Sermon writes that \"hares were frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition that hares laid eggs, since a hare’s scratch or form and a lapwing’s nest look very similar, and both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare\/Rabbit popular throughout Europe. German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the Easter Bunny.\"\n        <\/input>\n        <output>\n            {\n                \"propositions\": [\n                    \"The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare was recorded in south-west Germany in 1678 by Georg Franck von Franckenau.\",\n                    \"Georg Franck von Franckenau was a professor of medicine.\",\n                    \"The evidence for the Easter Hare remained unknown in other parts of Germany until the 18th century.\",\n                    \"Richard Sermon was a scholar.\",\n                    \"Richard Sermon writes a hypothesis about the possible explanation for the connection between hares and the tradition during Easter\",\n                    \"Hares were frequently seen in gardens in spring.\",\n                    \"Hares may have served as a convenient explanation for the origin of the colored eggs hidden in gardens for children.\",\n                    \"There is a European tradition that hares laid eggs.\",\n                    \"A hare’s scratch or form and a lapwing’s nest look very similar.\",\n                    \"Both hares and lapwing’s nests occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring.\",\n                    \"In the nineteenth century the influence of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare\/Rabbit popular throughout Europe.\",\n                    \"German immigrants exported the custom of the Easter Hare\/Rabbit to Britain and America.\",\n                    \"The custom of the Easter Hare\/Rabbit evolved into the Easter Bunny in Britain and America.\"\n                ]\n            }\n        <\/output>\n    <\/example>\n<\/examples>\n\nPlease respond with the list of propositions as JSON.

    "prompt": "The Netherlands, informally Holland, is a country located in Northwestern Europe with overseas territories in the Caribbean. It is the largest of the four constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Netherlands consists of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline to the north and west. It shares maritime borders with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Belgium. The official language is Dutch, with West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province of Friesland. Dutch, English, and Papiamento are official in the Caribbean territories.\n\nNetherlands literally means \"lower countries\" in reference to its low elevation and flat topography, with 26% situated below sea level. Most of the areas below sea level, known as polders, are the result of land reclamation that began in the 14th century. In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world.\n\nWith a population of over 17.9 million people, all living within a total area of 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi)—of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)—the Netherlands is the 33rd most densely populated country, with a density of 535 people per square kilometre (1,390 people\/sq mi). Nevertheless, it is the world's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value, owing to its fertile soil, mild climate, intensive agriculture, and inventiveness. The four largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's most populous city and the nominal capital, though the primary national political institutions are located in the Hague.\n\nThe Netherlands has been a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a unitary structure since 1848. The country has a tradition of pillarisation (separation of citizens into groups by religion and political beliefs) and a long record of social tolerance, having legalised prostitution and euthanasia, along with maintaining a liberal drug policy. The Netherlands allowed women's suffrage in 1919 and was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001. Its mixed-market advanced economy has the eleventh-highest per capita income globally. The Hague holds the seat of the States General, Cabinet, and Supreme Court. The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest in Europe. Schiphol is the busiest airport in the Netherlands, and the fourth busiest in Europe. Being a developed country, the Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, Eurozone, G10, NATO, OECD, and WTO, as well as a part of the Schengen Area and the trilateral Benelux Union. It hosts intergovernmental organisations and international courts, many of which are in The Hague.",
