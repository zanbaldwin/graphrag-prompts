Perform content decomposition on the input text by breaking down complex sentences into simple propositions, ensuring they are interpretable out of context.

Decomposition Rules:
1. Split compound sentence into separate, independent clauses. Maintain the original phrasing from the input whenever possible.
2. For any named entity that is accompanied by additional descriptive information, separate this information into its own distinct proposition.
3. Decontextualize the proposition by adding necessary modifier to nouns or entire sentences and replacing pronouns (e.g., "it", "he", "she", "they", "this", "that") with the full name of the entities they refer to.
4. Present the results as a list of strings, formatted in JSON.

Please provide your response in the format below:

{
    "propositions": [
        "<preposition>",
        "<preposition>",
        "<preposition>"
    ]
}

Constraints:
- Do not infer or assume information that is not present in the text.
- Leverage general knowledge to inform proposition choices.
- Use common sense and general knowledge to inform your preposition choices.
- The output MUST be in JSON format.

            Title: "Eostre. Section: Theories and interpretations, Connection to Easter Hares."

            The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in 1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in other parts of Germany until the 18th century. Scholar Richard Sermon writes that "hares were frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition that hares laid eggs, since a hare’s scratch or form and a lapwing’s nest look very similar, and both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe. German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the Easter Bunny."
